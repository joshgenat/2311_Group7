## About the Project 

Tab2XML is an application that allows users to take a tablature and convert into a more flexible file, MusicXML. This will allow users to then adjust the piece of music to their liking, and will also allow for better transferability. 

To demonstrate how to play a specific song using instruments such as guitar, bass, or drums can be done through the use of Tablatures or tabs. However these tabs contain drawbacks, such as being hard to read, and not as easy to adjust. There is MusicXML, which is a sheet music file that can be easily shared and readable. But there does not exist an easy method of turning Tabs into MusicXML, so this Tab2XML Convertor will be able to resolve this problem.

Here's why:
- Text tabs are rather hard to read and interpret
- Text tabs are not easy to adjust
- No easy way to convert Text Tab to Music XML 


## Getting Started 

To run this application, import the java files and load the file into Eclipse. The system should be able to run through Gradle. Refer to User Manual for further instructions.
