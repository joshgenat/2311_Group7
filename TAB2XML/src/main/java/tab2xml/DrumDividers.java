	 * One issue we were having with calculating duration is sometimes the duration would be odd numbers, this is our system skipped the columns of  '|' characters
	 * this columns is meant to symbolize the end of 16 beats, and therefore the duration count should end right here. I didn't want to include the '|' characters in my rowValue and colValue arrays
	 * so this class is might to go through the inputed drum tab and return an array with the columns at which the '|' appear. For example it should return an array like {2,19.32.48}
	 * Was having some out of bounds errors at the beginning but fixed it, if you can think of a better way to do this pls go ahead - uthithv
